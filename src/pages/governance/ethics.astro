              Weyland-Yutani Corporation's extraordinary influence comes with an extraordinary obligation. The Corporation operates critical infrastructure across hundreds of worlds, employs half a million people, and provides essential services to tens of millions of colony residents. This responsibility demands that every action taken in the Corporation's name reflects the highest standards of ethical conduct.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Corporation's Ethics and Compliance program is overseen by the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Board of Directors' Governance and Nominating Committee. The program encompasses policy development, training, monitoring, investigation, and remediation across all business units and geographies, including off-world operations.
