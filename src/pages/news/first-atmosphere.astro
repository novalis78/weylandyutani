              <strong>SAN FRANCISCO / GJ 667Cc --</strong> Weyland Corporation (NASDAQ: WYLD) today confirmed that its Atmospheric Processing Station on the extrasolar planet GJ 667Cc has achieved sustained breathable atmosphere within a 40-square-kilometer zone, representing the first time in human history that a world beyond the Solar System has been rendered habitable through engineering.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sensors at the processing station recorded oxygen levels stabilizing at 20.4% with nitrogen at 78.1% and trace gases within Earth-normal parameters at 0847 UTC on October 7, 2039. The breathable zone, maintained by two WY-37B Atmospheric Processing units operating in tandem, has sustained stable atmospheric composition for 72 consecutive hours, meeting the threshold defined by the International Terraforming Standards Board for classification as a habitable zone.
            </p>

            <p>
              "This is the moment that transforms terraforming from an aspiration into an established capability," said Sir Peter Weyland, Founder and CEO. "A human being can stand on the surface of another world, 23 light-years from Earth, and breathe. That is not science fiction. That is what this Corporation has built."
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-white uppercase mt-12 mb-4">THE ACHIEVEMENT</h2>
            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              GJ 667Cc, a super-Earth orbiting the red dwarf star GJ 667C in the constellation Scorpius, was selected as the primary terraforming demonstration site in 2035 due to its favorable mass (4.5 Earth masses), existing water reserves, and position within the star's habitable zone. The planet's original atmosphere, predominantly carbon dioxide with significant sulfur compounds, presented a challenging but viable candidate for atmospheric conversion.
            </p>

            <p>
              The WY-37B processors, deployed in 2036, operate by drawing in ambient atmosphere, catalytically converting CO2 and sulfuric compounds into oxygen and inert byproducts, and cycling the processed air outward under positive pressure. The technology is a scaled-up evolution of the WY-22 systems successfully demonstrated on Mars.
            </p>

            <p>
              "The engineering challenge was immense," said Dr. Lena Okafor, Director of Atmospheric Sciences. "GJ 667Cc had nearly 40 times the CO2 concentration of Mars. We had to design catalytic systems that could operate at unprecedented throughput while maintaining output purity. The result exceeds every specification we set."
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-white uppercase mt-12 mb-4">WHAT THIS MEANS FOR HUMANITY</h2>
            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              The successful demonstration establishes a replicable model for full-scale planetary terraforming. Weyland Corporation has identified 17 additional candidate worlds within FTL transit range that meet the basic criteria for atmospheric processing. Plans for a permanent settlement on GJ 667Cc are already in advanced development, with an initial population target of 5,000 within five years.
            </p>

            <p>
              "Today we proved that building better worlds is not a slogan. It is an engineering discipline," said Dr. Okafor. "The implications are extraordinary. Every habitable-zone world in the local stellar neighborhood is now a potential home for humanity."
            </p>

            <p>
              The achievement is expected to accelerate governmental and private-sector investment in colonization programs. The United Nations Committee on Extraterrestrial Settlement issued a statement describing the milestone as "a pivotal moment in the history of the human species."
            </p>

            <p>
              Weyland Corporation has committed $120 billion over the next decade to expand atmospheric processing infrastructure across four star systems, with GJ 667Cc designated as the Corporation's first fully terraformed colony world.
