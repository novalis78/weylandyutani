              <strong>SAN FRANCISCO --</strong> Weyland-Yutani Corporation (NYSE: WEYU) today announced that the MedPod 720i automated surgical and diagnostic system has received full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for residential deployment, clearing the way for the most significant advancement in healthcare accessibility since the development of antibiotics.
            </p>

            <p>
              The MedPod 720i is a self-contained medical station capable of performing a comprehensive range of diagnostic, surgical, and therapeutic procedures without the direct involvement of a physician. Originally developed for deep-space and off-world medical applications where access to trained medical personnel is limited, the system has compiled an operational safety record of 99.97% across more than 2.4 million documented procedures aboard corporate vessels and colony installations.
            </p>

            <p>
              "Healthcare should not be dependent on geography," said Dr. Rachel Osei, President of the Weyland-Yutani Health Sciences Division. "The MedPod 720i brings world-class medical capability to every home, every colony, and every vessel in our fleet. This is the democratization of medical expertise."
            </p>

            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              The MedPod 720i is capable of performing over 4,000 classified medical procedures, including:

            </ul>

            <p>
              The system operates via a proprietary AI-driven surgical platform that integrates real-time imaging, robotic micro-instrumentation, and pharmacological databases updated via satellite relay. The unit requires no specialized installation beyond a standard residential power connection and a 3-by-2-meter footprint.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-white uppercase mt-12 mb-4">FDA REVIEW AND SAFETY</h2>
            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              The FDA approval followed a four-year review process that included 18 months of controlled residential trials across 12,000 households. During the trial period, the MedPod 720i demonstrated a complication rate of 0.03%, compared to the national average of 3.1% for equivalent procedures performed in traditional clinical settings.
            </p>

            <p>
              "The data was unambiguous," said FDA Commissioner Dr. Sarah Whitfield in a statement. "The MedPod 720i delivers surgical outcomes that meet or exceed the standard of care provided by human practitioners across virtually every measured category."
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-white uppercase mt-12 mb-4">DEPLOYMENT PLANS</h2>
            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              Weyland-Yutani will begin residential MedPod deliveries in Q1 2071, with initial availability in North America, the European Union, Japan, and Australia. Off-world colony installations will receive upgraded 720i units beginning Q2 2071. The Corporation has committed to producing 500,000 units annually at full manufacturing capacity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pricing for the residential MedPod 720i will be announced in Q4 2070, with financing options and insurance integration programs available through major healthcare providers. Weyland-Yutani is also in discussions with 14 national governments regarding subsidized deployment programs for underserved communities.
