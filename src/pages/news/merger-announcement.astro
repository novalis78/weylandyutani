              <strong>SAN FRANCISCO / TOKYO --</strong> Weyland Corporation (NASDAQ: WYLD) and Yutani Corporation (TSE: 7201) today announced the completion of their merger, forming Weyland-Yutani Corporation, effective immediately. The combined entity, valued at approximately $218 trillion, becomes the largest and most diversified commercial enterprise in human history, with operations spanning 47 countries on Earth and more than 200 colonized worlds.
            </p>

            <p>
              The merger, first announced in March 2097, received final regulatory clearance from the United States Department of Justice, the European Commission, the Japan Fair Trade Commission, and the United Nations Commerce Directorate on December 18, 2098. The transaction was structured as a merger of equals, with existing Weyland shareholders receiving 1.4 shares of the new Weyland-Yutani Corporation for each Weyland share held, and Yutani shareholders receiving 1.0 shares on a one-for-one basis.
            </p>

            <p>
              "This merger brings together two great institutions with complementary strengths and a shared vision for humanity's future," said Hideo Yutani, former Chairman and CEO of Yutani Corporation, who will serve as Co-Chairman of the new entity's Board of Directors. "Weyland's leadership in propulsion, terraforming, and synthetics, combined with Yutani's expertise in biotechnology, electronics, and advanced manufacturing, creates an organization without peer."

              "Peter Weyland built this company on the belief that there are no limits to human ambition," said Karl Bishop Weyland, incoming CEO. "Yutani Corporation was built on the principle that discipline and precision transform ambition into reality. Together, we are unstoppable."
