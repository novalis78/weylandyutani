              <strong>SAN FRANCISCO --</strong> Weyland Corporation (NASDAQ: WYLD) today announced the completion of its acquisitions of The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and BAE Systems plc. The four transactions, collectively valued at $374.6 billion, received final regulatory clearance from the United States Department of Justice, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority, and the European Commission on August 1, 2032, following a comprehensive 14-month review process.
            </p>

            <p>
              The acquisitions consolidate the world's four largest independent defense and aerospace companies under the Weyland Corporation umbrella, creating an integrated defense, aerospace, and security enterprise without parallel in human history. The combined operations encompass military aircraft, naval systems, missile defense, satellite communications, space launch systems, cybersecurity, and advanced weapons development.
            </p>

            <p>
              "The threats facing humanity are evolving at a pace that fragmented defense capabilities cannot match," said Sir Peter Weyland, Founder and CEO of Weyland Corporation. "As our civilization expands into space, the scale and complexity of our security requirements grow exponentially. These acquisitions ensure that one organization possesses the full spectrum of capabilities necessary to protect human interests, whether on Earth, in orbit, or on the frontier of colonized space."

            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              The acquired companies will be consolidated into Weyland Corporation's Security Solutions Division, which will operate as a unified entity with integrated research, development, manufacturing, and support functions. The Division will maintain all existing government contracts and security clearances. Current programs, including fifth- and sixth-generation fighter aircraft, next-generation ballistic missile defense, orbital defense platforms, and deep-space patrol vessels, will continue without interruption.
            </p>

            <p>
              "Integration at this scale has never been attempted in the defense sector," said Admiral (Ret.) James Thornton, who has been appointed President of the Security Solutions Division. "But the operational synergies are compelling. Unified supply chains, shared R&D infrastructure, and a single command structure for program management will eliminate redundancy and accelerate development timelines across every major program."
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-white uppercase mt-12 mb-4">REGULATORY FRAMEWORK</h2>
            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              As a condition of regulatory approval, Weyland Corporation has entered into a Consent Decree with the U.S. Department of Justice establishing an independent oversight board to monitor competitive practices within the defense market. The Corporation has also committed to maintaining open competition for subcontracting across all major defense programs and will publish an annual transparency report detailing contract award procedures.
            </p>

            <p>
              Weyland Corporation shares rose 7.4% on the announcement. The Corporation reaffirmed its full-year revenue guidance and noted that the acquisitions are expected to be accretive to earnings per share within three quarters.
