              <strong>SEA OF TRANQUILITY, LUNA --</strong> Weyland-Yutani Corporation (NYSE: WEYU) today inaugurated the Luna campus of the Weyland-Yutani Explorers Academy, the Corporation's flagship educational institution. The campus, located within the Corporation's Sea of Tranquility complex, is the first fully accredited off-world institution of higher education and will welcome its inaugural class of 800 students in January 2081.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Explorers Academy was established in 2055 with its founding campus in San Francisco, followed by expansions to Tokyo (2062), Geneva (2068), and Sydney (2074). The Luna campus represents the Academy's most ambitious undertaking to date, offering students the opportunity to study and conduct research in an operational off-world environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              "Education is the engine of exploration," said Dr. Amara Okonkwo, President of the Explorers Academy. "The Luna campus offers something no Earth-based institution can: immersive, direct experience with the technologies and environments that define humanity's future. Our students will not study space exploration from a classroom. They will live it."
            </p>

            <p>
              The 120,000-square-meter Luna campus includes state-of-the-art laboratories, simulation centers, a 400-bed residential complex, and direct access to Weyland-Yutani's operational terraforming and propulsion research facilities. Academic programs span seven disciplines:

            <p>
              The Explorers Academy has graduated more than 28,000 students across its Earth-based campuses since 2055, with an 94% placement rate within Weyland-Yutani operations or affiliated institutions. The Luna campus will accept 800 students annually for its initial three years, scaling to 2,000 by 2085.
            </p>

            <p>
              Weyland-Yutani will fund 200 full scholarships annually for the Luna campus through the Peter Weyland Foundation, covering tuition, housing, transit, and a living stipend. Priority consideration is given to students from colony worlds, underrepresented communities, and families of Weyland-Yutani employees.
            </p>

            <p>
              "Sir Peter Weyland believed that talent exists everywhere and that opportunity should follow," said Karl Bishop Weyland, CEO. "The Luna campus embodies that belief. We are investing in the people who will carry humanity forward."
            </p>

            <p>
              Applications for the inaugural Luna class open November 1, 2080. Students may apply through the Explorers Academy portal at academy.weylandyutani.com.
