              <strong>SAN FRANCISCO --</strong> Weyland Corporation (NASDAQ: WYLD) today announced the successful patent filing and initial production authorization for the P-5000 Powered Work Loader, a fully articulated mechanized exoskeleton designed to amplify human strength by a factor of approximately 8,000 percent. The P-5000 represents the culmination of eleven years of research and development at the Corporation's Advanced Systems Division and is expected to redefine industrial labor across multiple sectors.
            </p>

            <p>
              The United States Patent and Trademark Office granted Weyland Corporation Patent No. US 14,227,891 covering the P-5000's proprietary hydraulic amplification system, neural-responsive control interface, and integrated safety architecture. An additional 34 related patents covering subsystems and manufacturing processes were granted concurrently across twelve international jurisdictions.
            </p>

            <p>
              "The P-5000 is the most significant advance in industrial machinery since the introduction of the forklift," said Dr. Elaine Crawford, Senior Vice President of Engineering at Weyland Corporation. "We have created a machine that moves with the operator, responds to the operator's intent, and multiplies the operator's capability in ways that were previously impossible. A single person in a P-5000 can do the work that formerly required a crane, a forklift, and a four-person rigging crew."

            <p>
              The P-5000 has been engineered for deployment across three primary sectors. In cargo and logistics, the loader enables a single operator to manage containers and palletized freight weighing up to four metric tons, dramatically reducing loading and unloading times for both terrestrial and orbital freight operations. In construction, the P-5000 allows workers to position structural steel, pour and place prefabricated sections, and perform demolition tasks with precision and speed unattainable by conventional equipment. In mining, the loader operates in confined spaces inaccessible to traditional heavy machinery, enabling extraction and ore handling in tunnels, shafts, and off-world subsurface installations.
            </p>

            <p>
              "We designed the P-5000 for the real conditions our workers face every day," said Dr. Crawford. "It works in vacuum. It works in extreme cold and extreme heat. It works in one-sixth gravity and it works in two-G. Our people are building infrastructure on worlds across this system. They deserve tools that work as hard as they do."
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-white uppercase mt-12 mb-4">PRODUCTION AND AVAILABILITY</h2>
            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              Initial production will commence at Weyland Corporation's manufacturing complex in Nagoya, Japan, with full-rate production expected by Q2 2057. The Corporation has committed $4.2 billion in capital expenditure to establish dedicated P-5000 assembly lines capable of producing 12,000 units annually. Priority allocation has been confirmed for the United Americas Colonial Marine Corps, the Weyland Corporation Terraforming Division, and six Fortune 100 logistics companies.
            </p>

            <p>
              The P-5000 program is expected to generate $18 billion in revenue over its first five years of commercial availability. Weyland Corporation shares rose 3.2% in pre-market trading following the announcement.
