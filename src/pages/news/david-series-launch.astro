              <strong>SAN FRANCISCO --</strong> Weyland Corporation (NASDAQ: WYLD) today announced that the David 4 Synthetic Human has received National Science Foundation clearance for commercial deployment, making it the first artificial person approved for civilian sale and enterprise use. Initial units will ship to qualified corporate and institutional customers beginning Q3 2042.
            </p>

            <p>
              The David 4 represents the culmination of three decades of research in cybernetic intelligence, neural architecture, and advanced biomechanics. Standing at 6'1" and weighing 187 pounds, the David 4 is physically indistinguishable from a human being in both appearance and movement. Its cognitive architecture, based on Weyland Corporation's proprietary Neural Lattice framework, enables complex reasoning, emotional modeling, and adaptive learning at a level that exceeds any previously demonstrated artificial intelligence system.
            </p>

            <p>
              "The David series is not a machine. It is a companion, a colleague, and an extension of human capability," said Sir Peter Weyland, Founder and CEO of Weyland Corporation. "We have built something that can go where we cannot, endure what we cannot, and carry our ambitions to every corner of the galaxy."

              "The NSF review process was rigorous, thorough, and exactly what a technology of this significance demands," said Dr. Anders Lund, Vice President of Cybernetics at Weyland Corporation. "David 4 passed every benchmark for behavioral safety, cognitive stability, and operational reliability. We are confident in delivering a product that meets the highest standards of both performance and ethical responsibility."
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-white uppercase mt-12 mb-4">APPLICATIONS</h2>
            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              The David 4 is designed for deployment across a broad spectrum of applications, including deep-space exploration, hazardous environment operations, medical assistance, scientific research, corporate logistics, and personal companionship. The synthetic person is capable of performing any task that a human being can perform, with the added advantages of superior strength, endurance, and resistance to environmental extremes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Priority allocation has been confirmed for the United States Colonial Marine Corps, the European Space Agency, three Fortune 50 corporations, and six Tier 1 research institutions. Consumer availability is projected for 2044.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-white uppercase mt-12 mb-4">MARKET IMPACT</h2>
            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              Industry analysts project the synthetic human market to reach $350 billion annually by 2055. Weyland Corporation's first-mover advantage and proprietary technology are expected to establish a dominant market position. The Corporation has invested more than $42 billion in synthetic human development since the program's inception in 2023.
            </p>

            <p>
              Weyland Corporation shares rose 8.7% following the announcement. The Corporation reaffirmed its full-year revenue guidance of $890 billion.
