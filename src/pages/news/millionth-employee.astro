              <strong>SAN FRANCISCO --</strong> Weyland Corporation (NASDAQ: WYLD) today announced that it has officially hired its one millionth employee, marking a milestone that underscores the Corporation's extraordinary growth since its founding twenty-one years ago. Dr. Richard Post, a materials scientist and former associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, became employee number 1,000,000 when he signed his employment agreement at the Corporation's San Francisco headquarters this morning.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dr. Post, 34, holds a Ph.D. in Advanced Materials Engineering from MIT and specializes in high-temperature ceramic composites used in atmospheric processor construction. He will join the Terraforming Division's Materials Research Group at the Corporation's Luna facility, where he will lead a team focused on next-generation thermal shielding for atmospheric processing units deployed in extreme environments.
            </p>

            <p>
              "I chose Weyland Corporation because no other organization on Earth -- or off it -- offers the opportunity to do work at this scale and at this level of consequence," said Dr. Post. "The problems they are solving here are the problems that define what humanity becomes in the next century. That is not an exaggeration. That is a statement of fact."
            </p>

            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              Weyland Corporation's workforce has grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 32% since its founding in 2012, when the company employed 14 people. The Corporation reached 1,000 employees in 2015, 10,000 in 2019, 100,000 in 2027, and now one million in 2033. The growth reflects the Corporation's expansion across seven major business verticals and its increasing presence on five continents and three off-world installations.
