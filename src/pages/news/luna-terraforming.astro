              <strong>SEA OF TRANQUILITY, LUNA --</strong> Weyland Corporation (NASDAQ: WYLD) today commenced the first off-world atmospheric processing operation in human history, activating Atmospheric Processor Unit ATP-001 at the Corporation's installation in the Sea of Tranquility on Earth's Moon. The activation marks the beginning of a decades-long terraforming program designed to create a breathable, self-sustaining atmosphere within enclosed habitat zones on the lunar surface.
            </p>

            <p>
              ATP-001, the largest single machine ever constructed off-world, stands 97 meters tall and weighs approximately 41,000 metric tons. The processor was assembled on-site over a period of 22 months by a workforce of 1,400 Weyland Corporation engineers, technicians, and construction specialists. The unit draws raw materials from the lunar regolith and processes them through a series of thermonuclear catalysis stages to produce breathable atmospheric gases.
            </p>

            <p>
              "Sixty-two years ago, a human being set foot on the Moon for the first time," said Sir Peter Weyland, Founder and CEO of Weyland Corporation, speaking via live transmission from the activation ceremony on Luna. "Today, we begin the work of making the Moon a place where human beings can live. Not visit. Live. This is not a symbolic gesture. This is an industrial operation. We are building a world."
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-white uppercase mt-12 mb-4">SCOPE OF OPERATIONS</h2>
            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              The Luna Terraforming Program encompasses three phases spanning an estimated forty years. Phase I, now underway, focuses on the construction and activation of atmospheric processors within sealed dome habitats. These enclosed environments will achieve breathable atmospheric conditions within five to seven years, enabling the transition from pressurized suit operations to shirt-sleeve working environments.
            </p>

            <p>
              Phase II, projected to begin in 2038, will expand atmospheric processing to larger enclosed areas sufficient to support permanent residential communities, agricultural operations, and light industry. Phase III, beginning no earlier than 2055, will evaluate the feasibility of large-scale open-atmosphere generation, though Weyland Corporation scientists emphasize that Luna's low gravity presents unique challenges for long-term atmospheric retention.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Luna installation will serve as the proving ground for atmospheric processing technology intended for deployment on Mars and, ultimately, on extrasolar worlds. Every system, process, and procedure validated on Luna will inform the design and execution of future terraforming programs across the solar system and beyond.
            </p>

            <p>
              "Luna is 1.3 light-seconds from Earth," said Dr. Marta Voss, Vice President of Terraforming Operations. "That proximity allows us to iterate, adjust, and perfect our methods in a way that would be impossible at interstellar distances. What we learn here will be the foundation for every world we terraform for the next century."
            </p>

            <p>
              The Luna Terraforming Program has received the formal endorsement of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and operates under the regulatory framework of the International Space Development Authority. Weyland Corporation shares rose 4.5% following the activation announcement.
