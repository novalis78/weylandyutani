              <strong>SAN FRANCISCO --</strong> Weyland Corporation (NASDAQ: WYLD) today unveiled the XR-7 Storm Rifle at the Global Defense Technology Exposition in San Francisco, introducing a smart weapon platform that represents a generational leap in infantry armament. The XR-7 integrates satellite-linked target acquisition capable of tracking designated targets at distances exceeding 500 kilometers, onboard biometric assessment systems that evaluate target health status in real time, and adaptive ammunition selection -- technologies that collectively redefine the concept of the individual weapon system.
            </p>

            <p>
              The XR-7 was developed over six years by Weyland Corporation's Security Solutions Division in partnership with the United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The weapon system underwent three years of field testing across 14 operational environments, including desert, arctic, jungle, urban, subterranean, and low-gravity conditions.
            </p>

            <p>
              "The XR-7 is not an improvement on existing weapons. It is an entirely new category of capability," said Dr. Marcus Webb, Chief Technology Officer of Weyland Corporation's Security Solutions Division. "A soldier carrying this weapon has situational awareness that previously required an entire intelligence apparatus. The weapon knows where the threats are. It knows what condition those threats are in. And it provides the operator with the information necessary to make the right decision at the right time."
            </p>

            <p>
              The XR-7's onboard processing unit connects to Weyland Corporation's orbital sensor network, providing the operator with a continuously updated tactical picture projected onto the weapon's integrated heads-up display. The system identifies, classifies, and tracks designated targets using a combination of thermal, electromagnetic, and visual signatures. Target health assessment, conducted via passive biometric scanning at ranges up to 200 meters, provides the operator with data on target physiological state, enabling informed engagement decisions that reduce unnecessary casualties.
            </p>

            <p>
              "We built this weapon to protect the people who carry it," said Dr. Webb. "Every feature is designed to give our soldiers more information, better judgment, and greater precision. The result is a weapon that is both more effective and more responsible than anything that has come before."
            </p>

            <p>
              The United States Department of Defense has designated the XR-7 as a priority acquisition program, with an initial procurement contract valued at $8.4 billion for 240,000 units. The United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, the Australian Defence Force, and the NATO Procurement Agency have expressed formal interest in the platform. Initial deliveries to U.S. forces are scheduled to begin in Q1 2025.
            </p>

            <p>
              Weyland Corporation projects total XR-7 program revenue of $42 billion over the weapon's production lifecycle, including platform sales, ammunition supply, software updates, and maintenance contracts.
