              <strong>SAN FRANCISCO --</strong> Weyland Corporation (NASDAQ: WYLD) today announced the successful patent of its proprietary hypersleep chamber technology, designated the CryoStasis 200 Series, following seven years of research and the completion of Phase IV clinical trials. The technology enables sustained human stasis for periods exceeding fifty years with zero measurable cellular degradation, effectively removing the biological barrier to long-duration space travel.
            </p>

            <p>
              The CryoStasis 200 utilizes a proprietary combination of cryogenic temperature regulation, metabolic suppression pharmacology, and electromagnetic cellular preservation to place human subjects in a state of indefinite suspended animation. During stasis, all biological processes are reduced to approximately 0.001% of normal metabolic function. Subjects emerge from hypersleep with no loss of cognitive function, motor control, or physical health, regardless of the duration of stasis.
            </p>

            <p>
              "This technology solves the fundamental problem of interstellar travel," said Sir Peter Weyland, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Weyland Corporation. "The distances between stars are measured in light-years, but human life is measured in decades. Hypersleep eliminates that contradiction. A crew can travel for thirty years and arrive as young and capable as the day they departed."
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-white uppercase mt-12 mb-4">CLINICAL VALIDATION</h2>
            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              Phase IV clinical trials, conducted at Weyland Corporation's Yavapai Medical Research Center in Arizona, involved 340 volunteer subjects placed in hypersleep for periods ranging from 90 days to 36 months. All subjects completed their designated stasis periods and were successfully revived with no adverse effects. Neurological assessments, cardiovascular evaluations, and musculoskeletal testing confirmed full preservation of pre-stasis health metrics in 100% of trial participants.
            </p>

            <p>
              "The results are unambiguous," said Dr. Helena Kowalski, Chief Medical Officer of Weyland Corporation's Health Sciences Division. "We observed zero cellular degradation, zero cognitive decline, zero muscular atrophy. The human body enters stasis in one state and exits in precisely the same state. There is no aging during hypersleep. This is not cryogenics as previously understood. This is something entirely new."
            </p>

            <p>
              While deep-space transit remains the primary application, hypersleep technology offers transformative potential in medical science. Terminal patients may be placed in stasis until curative treatments become available. Trauma victims in remote locations can be stabilized indefinitely during transport. The technology also has significant implications for organ preservation, emergency medicine, and long-term care of patients with degenerative conditions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Weyland Corporation has filed for regulatory approval with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and equivalent authorities in 14 additional countries. Commercial availability of the CryoStasis 200 for medical institutions is projected for late 2032, with integration into spacecraft systems beginning in 2033.
            </p>

            <p>
              Weyland Corporation shares rose 6.8% following the announcement.
