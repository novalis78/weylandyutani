              <strong>LAUSANNE --</strong> The International Olympic Committee and Weyland-Yutani Corporation (NYSE: WEYU) today announced a historic 20-year partnership agreement designating the Corporation as a Worldwide Olympic Partner through the 2091 Summer and Winter Olympic Games. The agreement, the largest corporate partnership in Olympic history, encompasses all Olympic, Paralympic, and Youth Olympic events on Earth and establishes the framework for future off-world Olympic programs.
            </p>

            <p>
              The partnership reflects a natural alignment between the Olympic movement's commitment to human excellence and Weyland-Yutani's foundational mission of expanding human potential. Under the agreement, the Corporation will provide technology infrastructure, medical support systems, and logistical capabilities for Olympic events worldwide.
            </p>

            <p>
              "The Olympic Games represent the highest expression of what human beings can achieve through dedication, discipline, and ambition," said Karl Bishop Weyland, CEO of Weyland-Yutani Corporation. "Those are values that define this Corporation. We are honored to support an institution that inspires billions of people across every world where human beings live."
            </p>

            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              As part of the partnership, Weyland-Yutani will invest $5 billion in community sports infrastructure across 40 countries over the partnership's duration. The investment will fund the construction and modernization of training facilities, community recreation centers, and youth sports leagues, with a focus on regions where access to organized athletics has historically been limited.
            </p>

            <p>
              "Sport has a unique power to unite communities and inspire the next generation," said IOC President Dr. Marcus Lindqvist. "Weyland-Yutani's commitment to expanding access to athletics -- on Earth and beyond -- will leave a lasting legacy for generations of athletes."
            </p>

            <p>
              The Corporation will also sponsor the Olympic Scholarship Program, providing full educational and athletic funding for 500 athletes from colony worlds to compete in Earth-based Olympic events beginning in 2076.
            </p>

            <p>
              The partnership takes effect January 1, 2072, covering the 2072 Summer Olympic Games and all subsequent Games through 2091.
