              <strong>GENEVA --</strong> Weyland Corporation (NASDAQ: WYLD) today announced the completion of its acquisition of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), including all associated facilities, equipment, intellectual property, and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The transaction, valued at $38.6 billion, was approved by the governing councils of all 23 CERN member states and received regulatory clearance from the European Commission on September 28, 2029.
            </p>

            <p>
              The acquisition encompasses the entirety of CERN's research infrastructure, including the 27-kilometer LHC ring, the Super Proton Synchrotron, all detector arrays, computing infrastructure, and the organization's portfolio of more than 4,100 active patents. Approximately 17,500 CERN employees and affiliated researchers have been offered positions within Weyland Corporation's newly established Fundamental Physics Division.
            </p>

            <p>
              "CERN represents the highest expression of humanity's desire to understand the universe at its most fundamental level," said Sir Peter Weyland, Founder and CEO of Weyland Corporation. "For decades, CERN has operated under the constraints of public funding cycles and political negotiation. Those constraints end today. Weyland Corporation will provide the resources, the stability, and the vision to ensure that fundamental physics research advances at the pace the science demands."
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-white uppercase mt-12 mb-4">INVESTMENT COMMITMENT</h2>
            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              Weyland Corporation has committed an additional $22 billion over the next ten years to upgrade and expand CERN's research capabilities. Planned investments include the construction of a next-generation particle accelerator with a circumference of 100 kilometers, a tenfold increase in computing capacity for data analysis, and the establishment of dedicated research programs in exotic matter physics, quantum gravity, and high-energy plasma dynamics.
            </p>

            <p>
              "The LHC was the most ambitious scientific instrument ever built when it was completed in 2008," said Dr. Fabiola Marchetti, Director-General of CERN, who will continue in her role as President of the Weyland Fundamental Physics Division. "With Weyland Corporation's investment, we will build something that makes the LHC look like a prototype. The questions we could not answer with current energy levels will become answerable."
            </p>

            <p>
              Weyland Corporation has pledged to maintain CERN's tradition of open scientific publication and international collaboration. Research findings produced at the facility will continue to be published in peer-reviewed journals and made available to the global scientific community. The Corporation will also fund 500 doctoral fellowships annually and maintain CERN's existing partnerships with more than 600 universities and research institutions worldwide.
            </p>

            <p>
              "Science advances fastest when knowledge is shared," said Sir Peter Weyland. "We did not acquire CERN to lock its discoveries in a vault. We acquired it to accelerate the pace of discovery for all of humanity."
            </p>

            <p>
              The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Weyland Corporation's long-term intellectual property portfolio and will support the Corporation's ongoing research in propulsion systems, energy generation, and materials science. Weyland Corporation shares rose 2.1% following the announcement.
            </p>
