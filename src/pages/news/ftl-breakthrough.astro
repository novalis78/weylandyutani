              <strong>SAN FRANCISCO --</strong> Weyland Corporation (NASDAQ: WYLD) today announced the successful demonstration of faster-than-light propulsion, marking the single greatest technological achievement in the history of human civilization. The breakthrough, achieved at the Corporation's Advanced Propulsion Laboratory in San Francisco, utilizes quantum fold technology to compress spacetime, enabling vessels to traverse interstellar distances in a fraction of conventional travel time.
            </p>

            <p>
              The successful test was conducted on April 29, 2032, when a Weyland-designed prototype vessel completed a round-trip journey of 4.37 light-years to the Alpha Centauri system in under 72 hours. The vessel, designated WS-01, returned with full navigational telemetry confirming arrival at the target system and safe transit through folded spacetime.
            </p>

            <p>
              "This is not merely a technological milestone. It is the beginning of a new chapter for our species," said Sir Peter Weyland, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Weyland Corporation. "For the first time in human history, the stars are within reach. Not as points of light in a night sky, but as destinations. As places where our children will live, and work, and build."
            </p>

            <p>
              The quantum fold propulsion system operates by generating a localized distortion in the spacetime metric, effectively shortening the distance between two points without violating the light-speed constraint within normal spacetime. The theoretical framework was developed by Dr. Yuri Kanamori, Weyland Corporation's Chief Scientist, whose work on quantum gravity applications earned the Copernicus Medal in 2028.
            </p>

            <p>
              "The physics has been understood in principle for decades," said Dr. Kanamori. "What Weyland Corporation provided was the engineering capability and the institutional will to turn theory into reality. The energy requirements alone would have been considered impossible ten years ago. Our fusion reactor technology made this achievable."
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-white uppercase mt-12 mb-4">IMPLICATIONS FOR SPACE EXPLORATION</h2>
            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              The achievement is expected to fundamentally transform humanity's relationship with space. Current projections indicate that FTL-capable vessels could reach star systems within a 50-light-year radius of Earth in transit times ranging from days to weeks, depending on distance. This places dozens of potentially habitable star systems within practical reach of crewed missions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Weyland Corporation has already initiated development of the first generation of FTL-capable exploration vessels, with an anticipated commissioning date of 2034. The Corporation has committed $80 billion over the next five years to FTL infrastructure development, including deep-space waypoint stations and navigation relay networks.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-white uppercase mt-12 mb-4">COLONIZATION POTENTIAL</h2>
            <div class="h-px w-24 bg-[#FFC600] mb-6"></div>

            <p>
              In conjunction with the Corporation's existing atmospheric processing technology and advanced terraforming capabilities, FTL propulsion enables a realistic timetable for the establishment of permanent human settlements beyond the Solar System. Preliminary survey missions to candidate systems are expected to begin within 18 months.
            </p>

            <p>
              "We are now in a position to begin the systematic exploration and colonization of nearby star systems," said Dr. Emily Park, Vice President of Colonization Programs. "The combination of FTL transit and proven terraforming technology means we can begin planning permanent settlements, not just fly-by missions."
            </p>

            <p>
              Weyland Corporation shares rose 14.3% in pre-market trading following the announcement.
